## memory management policy
基于NSObject protocol定义的一组方法和一套方法命名标准

### basic rules
- you own any object you create
you create an object using a method whose name begins with "alloc","new","copy", or "mutableCopy"
- you take ownership of an object using retain

- when you no longer need it, you must relinquish ownership of an object you own
[release] or [autorelease]
- you must not relinquish ownership of an object you do not own

### dealloc notes
Important: Never invoke another object’s dealloc method directly.
You must invoke the superclass’s implementation at the end of your implementation.
You should not tie management of system resources to object lifetimes; see Don’t Use dealloc to Manage Scarce Resources.
When an application terminates, objects may not be sent a dealloc message. Because the process’s memory is automatically cleared on exit, it is more efficient simply to allow the operating system to clean up resources than to invoke all the memory management methods.

简单来说，dealloc不应该被设计用来释放稀有资源。dealloc的调用可能被延迟或者跳过，比如由于bug或者应用被关闭tear-down。

## autorelease
``` objc
@autoreleasepool{
  //code that create autoreleased objects
}
```
At the end of the autorelease pool block, objects that received an autorelease message within the block are send a release message. 每收到一次autorelease就调用一次release。
通常是不需要用到autorelease，除了下面三种情况：
- 你的程序不是基于ui framework, 比如command-line tool
- 你的循环loop中创建了许多临时对象
在每次循环中创建一个autoreleasepool，来及时释放临时变量
- 你创建一个secondary thread
